# Update-App

(in progress)

An app that updates itself. Written with applescript.

The main goal of this applescript application is to give myself applescript experience. I have changed the way that I want this app to update. Originally I wanted it to check a networked location for updates, but that requires managing that networked location so that it always has the most up to date app. Instead, I have decided to have the app check github for updates. If it finds a new version it will prompt the user asking if they want to update.
